# FraudDetection 
The goal of this project is to predict fraud transactions in banks with common Machine Learning algorithms.

Dataset used for training and testing in project is [here](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/FraudDetection/blob/main/FraudDetection.ipynb).

Project is a variety of machine learning algorithms. Used algorithms are Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

For the whole project pipline and results go [here](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/FraudDetection/blob/main/Dataset.csv).
